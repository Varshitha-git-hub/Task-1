

CSS Code (in style.css file):

body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

#myCanvas {
  border: 1px solid black;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
/* 

How it works:

1. We create a canvas element with an ID of "myCanvas" and specify its width and height.
2. We use JavaScript to get a reference to the canvas element and then use the getContext() method to get a 2D drawing context.
3. We use various methods such as fillRect(), arc(), and fillText() to draw shapes and text on the canvas.
4. We style the canvas element using CSS to add a border and background color.

Benefits:

1. Dynamic graphics: The canvas element allows you to create dynamic graphics that can be manipulated using JavaScript.
2. Customizable: You can customize the appearance of the canvas element using CSS and JavaScript.
3. Interactive: You can create interactive graphics that respond to user input using JavaScript event handlers. */
